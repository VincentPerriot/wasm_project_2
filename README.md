# wasm_project

## Displaying 3D models and shader art inside an interactive platform

### Overview of the project.

#### 1 - Set up your environment:
I decided to go with Visual Studio 2022 and Cmake, you can find more information here: https://www.wasm.builders/

#### 2 - Build a minimal version of glm
In order to revise the maths and minimize the wasm build I decided to recreate the bare minimum for graphics maths from scratch.

#### 3 - Reduce size of 3d models and the few external libraries like assimp or ImGUI
Check the CMake file to learn more about it.

#### 4 - Add some Graphics!
At this point the website has most core functionalities you get from any renderer (UI, model Loading, lights, materials...)
The idea is to add more interesting stuff until it lags on my cheap laptop.

## Some of the things you can do at the moment (more to come!)
